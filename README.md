# CS61B Data Structures and Algorithms

The second course in the Berkeley CS61 series focuses on the design of data structures and algorithms, while giving students access to thousands of lines of engineering code and a preliminary understanding of software engineering through Java.

I took the spring 2018 semester version, and Professor Josh Hug, who started the course, generously made autograder open source, so that you could join the course for free on gradescope using the open invitation code on the website, so that you could easily test your own code.

14 LABS will let you implement most of the data structures taught in class, 10 Homework will let students use data structures and algorithms to solve practical problems, and 3 projects will let students have the opportunity to contact thousands of lines of engineering code, to hone their Java ability in practice.
